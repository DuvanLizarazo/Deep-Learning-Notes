    "## MACHINE LEARNING DEFINITION\n",
    "\n",
    "[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn\n",
    "without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "—Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "\n",
    "### When use ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use machine learning if we are facing any of the following scenearios:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of\n",
    "rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional\n",
    "approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## TYPES OF ML\n",
    "\n",
    "We can categorize machine learning into various types based on their training supervision, adaptability to real-time learning, or reliance on comparing new data points with known ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled data, which means it is provided with input-output pairs during training. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or decisions on unseen data.\n",
    "For example, consider a supervised learning task of predicting house prices based on features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location. In this case, the algorithm would be trained on a dataset where each data point includes features of a house (input) along with its corresponding sale price (output). By learning from this labeled data, the algorithm can then predict the price of a new house given its features.\n",
    "Some of the most important supervised learning algorithms are.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Linear Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Logistic Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Neural networks2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data. It aims to discover hidden relationships or groupings within the data without explicit guidance.\n",
    "An example of unsupervised learning is clustering customer data based on purchasing behavior. The algorithm groups customers into clusters based on similarities in their purchase history, without any predefined labels or categories. This can help businesses identify customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • K-Means Clustering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Autoencoders\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
