    "## MACHINE LEARNING DEFINITION\n",
    "\n",
    "[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn\n",
    "without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "—Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "\n",
    "### When use ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use machine learning if we are facing any of the following scenearios:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of\n",
    "rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional\n",
    "approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n",

    "• Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.\n",

    "## TYPES OF ML\n",
    "\n",
    "We can categorize machine learning into various types based on their training supervision, adaptability to real-time learning, or reliance on comparing new data points with known ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled data, which means it is provided with input-output pairs during training. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or decisions on unseen data.\n",
    "For example, consider a supervised learning task of predicting house prices based on features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location. In this case, the algorithm would be trained on a dataset where each data point includes features of a house (input) along with its corresponding sale price (output). By learning from this labeled data, the algorithm can then predict the price of a new house given its features.\n",
    "Some of the most important supervised learning algorithms are.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Linear Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Logistic Regression\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Neural networks2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data. It aims to discover hidden relationships or groupings within the data without explicit guidance.\n",
    "An example of unsupervised learning is clustering customer data based on purchasing behavior. The algorithm groups customers into clusters based on similarities in their purchase history, without any predefined labels or categories. This can help businesses identify customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • K-Means Clustering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Autoencoders\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    •Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semisupervised learning\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning is a paradigm that combines aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm leverages a small amount of labeled data along with a larger pool of unlabeled data to improve its performance in tasks such as classification or regression.A practical example of semi-supervised learning is in document classification. Suppose you have a large collection of text documents, but only a small subset of them are labeled with their corresponding categories (e.g., \"sports,\" \"politics,\" \"technology\"). By employing semi-supervised learning techniques, such as co-training or self-training, the algorithm can utilize both the labeled documents and the unlabeled ones to improve its classification accuracy. It might initially learn from the labeled documents and then use its confidence in those predictions to make predictions on the unlabeled documents, iteratively refining its model with each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, and unsupervised learning, which deals with unlabeled data, reinforcement learning operates on a different principle: trial and error.In reinforcement learning, the agent takes actions in an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, indicating how well it performed the task. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy—a strategy for selecting actions based on states—that maximizes cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "A classic example of reinforcement learning is training an AI to play a game, such as chess or Go. The agent (the AI player) interacts with the game environment by making moves and receives feedback in the form of wins, losses, or draws. By learning from these outcomes through trial and error, the agent gradually improves its strategy, learning to make better moves that lead to higher chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch and online learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In batch learning, the model is trained on the entire dataset at once. It requires access to the complete dataset before training begins, and the model is updated based on this complete dataset.  Suppose you have a dataset of housing prices with various features like size, location, and number of rooms. In batch learning, you would use the entire dataset to train your model. For instance, you might use linear regression to predict housing prices based on these features. The model learns from the entire dataset in one go, adjusting its parameters to minimize the error across all examples\n",
    "\r",
    " In online learning, the model is trained incrementally as new data becomes available. It updates its parameters continuously, learning from each new data point or small batches of data as they arrive, without needing the entire dataset at once: Consider a spam email filter. With online learning, the filter learns continuously as it encounters new emails. As each new email is classified as spam or not spam, the model updates its parameters to improve its classification accuracy. The model adapts to changing trends in spam emails over time, without needing to retrain on the entire dataset each time..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance based vs Model ba\n",
    "\n",
    "In instance-based learning, the model does not explicitly learn a generalized representation of the data. Instead, it memorizes the training examples and makes predictions based on similarity measures between new instances and the instances in the training data.  Consider the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. In k-NN, when a new data point is encountered, the model looks at the k nearest data points (neighbors) in the training set and predicts based on the majority class or average value of those neighbors. There is no explicit model training; instead, the algorithm stores the entire training dataset and uses it to make predictions at runtime.n: In model-based learning, the model learns a generalized representation of the data during the training phase. This representation is typically captured by parameters or coefficients that define a model's structure. The trained model is then used to make predictions on new dale: Linear regression is a classic example of model-based learning. During training, the model learns the coefficients (weights) that define a linear relationship between input features and the target variable. Once trained, the model can predict the target variable for new instances based on their feature values, using the learned coefficien\n",
